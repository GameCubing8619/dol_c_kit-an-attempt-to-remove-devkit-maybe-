# What is DOL C-Kit?
DOL C-Kit is a toolkit for compiling C code (or assembly) using DevkitPPC to inject into a GameCube/Wii \*.dol executable.  It has been written in such a way that it can be adapted to many different games.  You will need [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [pyelftools](https://github.com/eliben/pyelftools), and [DevKitPPC](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started) installed to use it.

# How to use it / The Project Class
DOL C-Kit is a Python module.  The recommended way to include it in your project is as a git submodule.

The Project class automates the tedious parts of compiling, linking, and injecting custom code into a \*.dol executable.  The Project class constructor has two optional parameters to set the "base_addr" and "verbose" member variables.  By default, they are set to None and False, respectively.

The Project class has many member variables that may be directly modified:
* src_dir: Path to C code (or assembly) source files.  Default is "".
* obj_dir: Path to output \*.o files and other files generated by DOL C-Kit to.  Default is "".
* devkitppc_path: Change this if DevKitPPC is not installed at its default location.
* project_name: Name used for certain files generated by DOL C-Kit.  Default is "project".
* optimization: GCC optimization level.  Default is "-O1".
* c_std: GCC C Standard.  Default is "c99".
* base_addr: The location new data will be put at.  This is set by the constructor, but may be modified directly as well.
* verbose: Flag for additional information printing.  This is set by the constructor, but may be modified directly as well.

By shifting forward the stack, db_stack, and OSArenaLo, space for new data can be allocated.  To do this, a patching function modifying a given game's "\_\_init_registers", "OSInit", and "\_\_OSThreadInit" functions must be written.  The project's save_dol function passes two parameters to this patching function: a DolFile class, and the base_addr of your project.

## Step 1: Populate the project
* `add_c_file(filepath)`<br>
Add a C source file to the project.

* `add_asm_file(filepath)`<br>
Add an assembly source file to the project.

* `add_linker_script_file(filepath)`<br>
Add a [linker script file](https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/ld-2.9.1/html_chapter/ld_3.html) to the project.  This is useful for defining symbols.

* `add_gecko_txt_file(filepath)`<br>
Add a [Gecko codelist](http://codes.rc24.xyz/) to the project.  The effects of the codes will be patched to the DOL permanently.  Only 00, 02, 04, 06, and C6 codetypes are supported for now.

* `add_branch(addr, funcname, LK=False)`<br>
Declare a branch to a symbol to be written at a given address.  Optionally, pass LK=True to declare a branchlink.

* `add_branchlink(addr, funcname)`<br>
Declare a branchlink to a symbol to be written at a given address.

* `add_pointer(addr, funcname)`<br>
Declare a pointer to a symbol to be written at a given address.

* `set_osarena_patcher(function)`<br>
Give your project a game-specific patching function to use to allocate space for new data.

## Step 2: Build the project
* `build_dol(in_dol_path, out_dol_path)`<br>
Compile, assemble, and link all source files into a single binary file.  Save changes to a \*.dol executable.  If no base_addr is specified, the ROM end will automatically be detected and used.  A new text section will be allocated to contain the new data.  If no text sections are available, a data section will be allocated instead.<br>
Note: Automatic ROM end detection does not work for DOLs that allocate space for .sbss2.

* `build_gecko(gecko_path)`<br>
!! This feature is a WIP !!  Compile, assemble, and link all source files into a single binary file.  Save changes to a large Gecko codelist.  OSArenaLo patchers are not used, and likely never will be worth implementing be due to timing limitations of Gecko codes.  Instead, existing data must be overwritten.  At the moment, Gecko codes included by the add_gecko_txt_file function are discared.

* `save_map(map_path, write_hooks=False)`<br>
Generate a CodeWarrior-like symbol map from the project.  Run this after building and before cleanup.  The write_hooks parameter can be enabled to print branch, branchlink, and pointer hook information to the Symbol Map in a way which Dolphin Emulator ignores.

* `cleanup()`<br>
Delete unimportant files created by DOL C-Kit.  This includes unlinked \*.o files, and <project_name>.o, <project_name>.bin, and <project_name>.map.
